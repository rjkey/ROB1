Description: This package contains a configurable node, services and a spawner script
                to start, stop and restart one or more controller plugins. Reusable
                controller types are defined for common Dynamixel motor joints. Both speed and
                torque can be set for each joint. This python package can be used by more
                specific robot controllers and all configurable parameters can be loaded
                via a yaml file.
